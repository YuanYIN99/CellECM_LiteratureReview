|1. | Cellular Contact Guidance Emerges from Gap Avoidance| 2020| Experiments show that cell alignment (or CG) depends on the micropatterns (eg. widths, gap sizes) of the underlying fibronectins. Simulations based on a statistical mechanics framework for living cells further support this.| 1. Try angular histogram (Fig5D); 2. Image analysis of cells, FAs, and nuclei (scripts in Mathematica)|
